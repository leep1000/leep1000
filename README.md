Hi ðŸ‘‹

As a motivated individual with a background in clinical research, I took the bold step of leaving my secure previous role to pursue a new career in technology after discovering a passion for coding during downtime at work. 


I now work for a global and forward-thinking leader in technology. Currently, I am gaining my Digital and Technological degree as well as developing proficiency in developing real-world business solutions.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small web projects and improving version control
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Power Platform and C#
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: leepalmerformal@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once vaccinated an 101 year-old lady. She was chill - seen it all before obviously.
