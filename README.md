Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

As a motivated individual with a background in clinical research, I have taken the bold step of leaving my secure previous role
to pursue a new career in technology after discovering a passion for coding during downtime at work. Currently, I attend a
Fullstack Developer Bootcamp, where I am gaining proficiency in web development, computational thinking and Agile
methodologies. I am excited to embrace this career change and am seeking an opportunity to apply my skills to contribute to
the growth and success of a forward-thinking tech company.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
